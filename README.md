Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The requiremens and goals of the app that I developed were to develope an inventory app for a warehouse where users can 
- login or create a new login
- display database information based on items in the warehouse where the user can create, delete, and update the items and the quanity in stock. 
- Access settings to allow for SMS messaging notifications


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The screens that I created to support the user needs were a login page, a new user page, the home page that displayed the grid with inventory items, and a settings page for users to access the SMS messaging setting. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
Testing the app to ensure that each function works, such as creating a new login, then logging in and adding, deleting, and updating items. The process of testing the code is important because it is essential to ensure the product being released to users is 100% functional and does not have any bugs that need to be worked out. 

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
